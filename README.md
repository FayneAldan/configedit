# ConfigEdit

Configuration editor using WebView

## Developer usage

This library is mainly meant to included within other applications for easy configuration.
You can compile ConfigEdit into an executable with `deno compile`:

```
deno compile -A --unstable https://deno.land/x/configedit/mod.ts --schema src/schema.json config.json
```

The user can override the config being edited by adding it as an argument to the compiled app
(or by dragging the config onto the executable).

You can also call the API directly from your own code, if you need to make some extra modifications.
See [example/advanced](example/advanced) for an advanced example
using YAML, version migration, and HTML in the schema.
